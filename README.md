# EPIDEMIC SPREADING ANALYSIS USING SOCIAL NETWORKS 

During my coursework, we were provided a task to analyse social interaction in a real life network during epidemic spreading. Me and my team mates are currently working on this project and would be uploading the entire report soon. This prevention gives you a small talk about the topic, why is it necessary to analyse such networks, and how to do the analysis using application called `Gephi` & `NetworkX`. 

### *NetworkX* 
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

### *Gephi*
Gephi is the leading visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks. Gephi is open-source and free.
