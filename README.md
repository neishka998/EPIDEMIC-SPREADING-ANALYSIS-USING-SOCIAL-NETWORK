# EPIDEMIC SPREADING ANALYSIS USING SOCIAL NETWORKS 

During my coursework, me & my teammates were provided a task to analyse social interaction in a real life network during epidemic spreading. Me and my team mates are currently working on this project and would be uploading the entire report soon. This prevention gives you a small talk about the topic, why is it necessary to analyse such networks, and how to do the analysis using application called `Gephi` & `NetworkX`. 

#### *`NetworkX`* 
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

#### *`Gephi`*
Gephi is the leading visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks. Gephi is open-source and free.




## *Objective:*
Simulating epidemic spreading through real friendship and co-location datasets.

Assessments of epidemic spreading in a population usually focus on large scale analyses, e.g. movements of people between cities or countries. Elucidate the spreading works at a small scale (i.e. within cities or communities). To combat an epidemics, it is critical to take into account the structure of the social network and how it supports or slows down spreading, and to model the effects of local changes in the network (such as lockdown). 

This project will rely on subsets of datasets available from the social network app Gowalla. Gowalla was a location-based social networking service. The first large-scale dataset is a friendship network, where each node is a user and each edge denotes friendship. The second large-scale dataset is a record of 6,442,890 checks-ins (including geographical coordinates) of these users over the period of Feb. 2009 - Oct. 2010. The project will be based on excerpts of these datasets, on a much smaller scale. 

By combining these two dataset sources, one can simulate a hypothetical epidemic spreading between friends who meet in a same place within a given time window, and see how the network structure influence this spreading. Then, specific measures can be proposed: for example, to allow a maximum travel distance within the city, or a maximum of friends one could visit. The analysis and subsequent measures proposed have to be based on network key features such as eigenvector centrality, node removal analysis, or other methods covered in the module.
